# Python Learning # 
### A bit about me
Hi, my name is Daniel, I am 32, and I am learning `Python` ATM (and everything related to programming for that matter). 
I'm Spanish and have a background in Translation, but decided to switch careers recently. 

### Purpose of this repository

Here I will upload the typical noob scripts someone writes while they are learning a new programming language. 
I will also use this repository to get a hold of how git works. 2x1!

### Help is very welcome!

If you see anything in here that makes you frown or gasp in disbelief, just tell me!   

I believe that someone getting corrected by someone else with a higher degree of command in whatever field is an 
integral part of any learning process, so I am very open to corrections. So please, any suggestion/s, any piece of 
advice and whatever tips&tricks you might have for me are more than welcome! Praise and congratulations are too! ;P
