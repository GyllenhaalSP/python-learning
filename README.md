# Python Learning

Hi, my name is Daniel, I am 32 and I am learning Python (and everything related to programming for that matter)!

I'm Spanish and have a background in Translation, but decided to switch careers recently.

Here I will upload the typical noob scripts someone writes while they are learning a new programming language.

I will also use this repository to get a hold of how git works. 2x1!

Any suggestion/s, any piece of advice and some tips&tricks are more than welcome!
