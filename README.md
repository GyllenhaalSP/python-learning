# Python Learning # 
### A bit about me
Hi, my name is Daniel, I am 32, and, for now, I am learning `Python` (and everything related to programming for 
that matter). 

I'm Spanish and I have a background in Translation, but recently I've decided to switch careers and try 
something I long ago thought was too difficult for me until I realized that speaking "computer-language" is no 
different than it is speaking a human language (except for the part where the computer is a 100% unforgiving of mistakes 
made by novices learning its language!).

Starting September '22 I will start going to sort of the equivalent of Community College here in Spain. I intend to 
get a degree in General Programming and Web Development in the next two years, but maybe I'll throw a Mobile App 
Development degree after that. Who knows...

### Purpose of this repository

Here I will upload the typical noob scripts or programs someone writes while they are learning a new programming 
language. Most of the scripts, games or programs you will find here are my own version of the "*100 days of code*" 
projects by Angela Yu and, maybe, if I find something interesting on the internet, I'll give it a go too or I try
to merge it with what I have already uploaded. 

Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" sounds promising too as a project feeder. That will be my next
target.

I will also use this repository to get a hold of how `Git` works, the CLI and the integration with `PyCharm` or `VSCode`. 2x1! 

### Help is very welcome!

If you see anything in here that makes you frown or gasp in disbelief, just tell me! Send me a message or engage in 
conversation with me! I don't bite, and I am eager to learn!

I believe that someone getting corrected by someone else with a higher degree of command in whatever field is an 
integral part of any learning process, so I am very open to corrections. So please, any suggestion/s, any piece of 
advice and whatever tips&tricks you might have for me are more than welcome! Praise and congratulations are too! ;P
